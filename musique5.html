    <h2>Paroles</h2>
    <br>
    <p>They say oh my God I see the way you shine <br>
        Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine<br>
        You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by<br>
        And now I beg to see you dance just one more time<br><br>
        Ooh I see you, see you, see you every time<br>
        And oh my I, I, I like your style<br>
        You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry<br>
        And now I beg to see you dance just one more time<br><br>
        So they say<br>
        Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh, oh, oh<br>
        I've never seen anybody do the things you do before<br>
        They say move for me, move for me, move for me, ay, ay, ay<br>
        And when you're done I'll make you do it all again<br><br>
        I said oh my God I see you walking by<br>
        Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes<br>
        Just like a monkey I've been dancing my whole life<br>
        But you just beg to see me dance just one more time<br><br>
        Ooh I see you, see you, see you every time<br>
        And oh my I, I like your style<br>
        You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry<br>
        And now I beg to see you dance just one more time<br><br>
        So they say<br>
        Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh, oh, oh<br>
        I've never seen anybody do the things you do before<br>
        They say move for me, move for me, move for me, ay, ay, ay<br>
        And when you're done I'll make you do it all again<br><br>
        They say<br>
        Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
        I've never seen anybody do the things you do before<br>
        They say move for me, move for me, move for me, ay, ay, ay<br>
        And when you're done I'll make you do it all again<br><br>
        Ooh<br>
        Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh<br>
        Ooh<br>
        Ah ah, ah<br><br>
        They say<br>
        Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh, oh, oh<br>
        I've never seen anybody do the things you do before<br>
        They say move for me, move for me, move for me, ay, ay, ay<br>
        And when you're done I'll make you do it all again<br><br>
        They say<br>
        Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
        I've never seen anybody do the things you do before<br>
        They say move for me, move for me, move for me, ay, ay, ay<br>
