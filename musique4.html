    <h2>Paroles</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Every time I hear this groove, it makes me want to move. <br>
        Must be the feeling it brings to you that makes you feel what to do.<br>
        I know I can't keep still so I don't try to hold you within.<br>
        When it comes, I start to yell, the next will be down on the floor.<br><br>
        
        Green lights start to flash, telling me it's time to go.<br>
        Sirens start to sound, that means for me to get on down.<br>
        It's time to move, time to get loose, anywhere you are.<br>
        It's time to groove, me and you out there on the floor.<br><br>
        
        There's no way to keep on grooving, no matter how you try.<br>
        And around, you feel that pain, I wouldn't tell you no lie.<br>
        Mister DJ, let the music play, play it all night long.<br>
        There's something, the rhythm of the beat that makes me carry on.<br><br>
        
        Green lights start to flash, telling me it's time to go.<br>
        Sirens start to sound, that means for me to get on down.<br>
        It's time to move, time to get loose, anywhere you are.<br>
        It's time to groove, me and you out there on the floor.<br><br>
        
        Feeyy it's time to let out the flow control, feeyy it's time to boogie.<br>
        Feeyy it's time to let out the flow control, feeyy it's time to boogie.<br><br>
        
        Time to move, time to groove.<br>
        It's time to move, time to get loose, everybody on the floor oh oh.<br>
        It's time to go some more oh oh oh oh.<br>
        Come on, get on down. Come on ! All night long.<br><br>
        
        Time to break it all down, do it all around.<br>
        Time to break it all down, do it all around.<br>
        Time to break it all down, do it all around.<br>
        
    </p>
