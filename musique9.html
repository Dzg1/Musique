    <h2>Paroles</h2>
    <br>
    <p>She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene <br>
        I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one<br>
        Who will dance on the floor in the round?<br>
        She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round<br><br>
        She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene<br>
        Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one<br>
        Who will dance on the floor in the round<br><br>
        People always told me be careful of what you do<br>
        And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts<br>
        And mother always told me be careful of who you love<br>
        And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth<br><br>
        Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
        She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br>
        But the kid is not my son<br>
        She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son<br><br>
        For forty days and forty nights<br>
        The law was on her side<br>
        But who can stand when she's in demand<br>
        Her schemes and plans<br>
        'Cause we danced on the floor in the round<br>
        So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice<br>
        (Do think twice, do think twice)<br><br>
        She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me<br>
        Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no)<br>
        'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby<br><br>
        People always told me be careful of what you do<br>
        And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts<br>
        She came and stood right by me<br>
        Just the smell of sweet perfume<br>
        This happened much too soon<br>
        She called me to her room<br><br>
        Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
        She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br>
        But the kid is not my son<br><br>
        Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
        She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br>
        But the kid is not my son<br>
        She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son<br><br>
        She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son<br><br>
        Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
        She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br>
        But the kid is not my son<br>
        She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son<br><br>
        She says I am the one<br>
        You know what you did, (she says he is my son) breaking my heart babe<br>
        She says I am the one<br><br>
        Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
        Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
        Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
        Billie Jean is not my lover (don't Billie Jean)<br>
        Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
        Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
